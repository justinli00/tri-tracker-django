TODO:
    - A bucket
        - Blockchain stuff
        - Don't let users select/modify author 
            - This needs to be done on the backend
            - Preventing it from being done on front end doesn't prevent direct api calls
        - author should return the name, somehow -- not just id
        - MORE TESTING

    - B bucket
        - User Profile model
        - Frontend

    - C bucket
        - Location services integration
